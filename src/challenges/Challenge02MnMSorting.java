/**
 * Created by dougylee on 1/11/18.
 *
 * We have lots of MnMs in a jar.
 * There are 3 colors:
 *  • Red
 *  • Green
 *  • Blue
 *
 * There is a bucket for each of the colors.
 * 10 MnMs are selected from the jar one at a time.
 * Each time, we put the MnM in it's respective bucket.
 *
 * The bucket with the most MnMs at the end wins.
 *
 *
 * Make a game for the user to see which color gets picked the most.
 *
 * 1. How do you represent each color?
 * 2. How do you represent each bucket?
 * 3. How would you let the user follow the "story"?
